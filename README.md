LocalTodos
==========

I'm getting on a flight to go on spring break and I don't want to have to pay for wifi just to use Parse, nor will I have internet at all times this week, so I'm going to build a local version of the Todo app I've been working on.

It will be a simple todo list application without persistence, without user accounts, without priorities. This app will also help me nail down what I want my Parse To-Do app to look like, and how it will work.
